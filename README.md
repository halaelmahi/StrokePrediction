# Healthcare Stroke Prediction: Machine Learning Models
This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting stroke using a 
healthcare dataset. The code performs various data preprocessing, feature 
engineering, model training, and evaluation steps. Below is a detailed 
explanation of the code and its functionality.
## Code Overview
The code in this repository performs various tasks related to the stroke 
dataset analysis. Below is a detailed overview of each task:
### Loading and Reading the Dataset Files
The code starts by loading and reading the dataset files (healthcaredataset-stroke-data.csv, train.csv, and test.csv) into pandas DataFrames. 
This allows us to easily manipulate and analyze the data.
### Merging the Training Datasets
Next, the code merges the training datasets (healthcare-dataset-strokedata.csv and train.csv) into a single DataFrame. The merged DataFrame is 
then saved as merged_dataset.csv. This step ensures that all relevant 
training data is combined for further analysis.
### Data Exploration
The code performs basic data exploration to gain insights into the 
dataset. This includes checking for missing values, exploring the data 
description, and analyzing the correlation between variables. 
Understanding the data helps in making informed decisions during the 
analysis and modeling process.
### Handling Missing Values
To ensure the integrity of the data, the code handles missing values. 
Rows with null values are dropped from the dataset to avoid any potential 
bias or inaccuracies in the analysis. This step helps in maintaining the 
quality of the data.
### Analyzing Class Imbalance
The target variable in the dataset is the presence or absence of stroke. 
The code analyzes the class imbalance in the target variable to 
understand the distribution of stroke cases. This analysis helps in 
determining if the dataset requires any balancing techniques to address 
the class imbalance.
### Encoding Categorical Variables
If there are categorical variables in the dataset, the code encodes them 
using label encoding. This step converts the categorical variables into 
numerical format, making them suitable for analysis and modeling. Label 
encoding assigns a unique numerical label to each category within a 
variable.
### Removing Columns with High Correlation
The code performs a correlation analysis between variables to identify 
any high correlation. If two variables have a correlation coefficient 
above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.9), one of the variables is removed to 
reduce multicollinearity. Removing highly correlated variables helps in 
improving the model's performance and interpretability.
### Normalizing the Data
To ensure consistency in the scale of the data, the code normalizes it. 
Normalization converts the data to a common scale, typically between 0 
and 1. This step prevents any particular feature from dominating the 
analysis due to its larger magnitude. Normalized data facilitates fair 
comparisons between variables.
### Splitting the Data
The code splits the data into training, validation, and testing datasets. 
The training dataset is used to train the predictive model, the 
validation dataset is used for model evaluation and parameter tuning, and 
the testing dataset is used to assess the final model's performance. 
Proper data splitting ensures the reliability of the model evaluation.
### Addressing Class Imbalance
If there is a class imbalance in the target variable, the code addresses 
it using oversampling with the RandomOverSampler technique. Oversampling 
increases the number of minority class samples to balance the dataset. 
This technique helps in improving the model's ability to predict the 
minority class accurately.
### Training and Evaluating Models
The code trains and evaluates different models on the stroke dataset. It 
includes models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support 
Vector Machines, and Neural Network. Each model is trained on the 
training dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics such as 
accuracy, F1-score, and recall. Model evaluation helps in selecting the 
best model for the given dataset.
### Predicting on the Validation Set
After training the models, the code predicts the presence or absence of 
stroke on the validation set. The predicted values are compared with the 
actual values to assess the model's performance. The performance metrics 
calculated earlier help in understanding the model's effectiveness in 
predicting stroke cases.
### Predicting on the Test Set
Using the best-performing model, the code predicts the presence or 
absence of stroke on the test set. These predictions are then used to 
generate a submission file that can be submitted for evaluation or 
further analysis. The submission file provides a record of the model's 
predictions on unseen data.
### Saving the Submission File
The code saves the submission file as submission.csv. This file contains 
the predictions made by the model on the test set. Saving the submission 
file allows for easy sharing, evaluation, or comparison with other 
models.
